**MELUS Conference Report/Project**

Due: Sessions 19 and 21

For [Conference Reports]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments/melus-conference-report-project), students attended [The 31st Annual MELUS Conference](https://networks.h-net.org/node/2606/discussions/144880/cfp-melus-31st-annual-conference-mit-april-27-30-2017) and wrote a report describing their experience.

Note: Grading for the MELUS project involves two parts of equal weight.
